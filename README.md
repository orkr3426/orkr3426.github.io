# IAT355-A2

## What is this website?
This website is my personal website which goes through my skills, experiences, etc (just like a resume!) and displays some visualizations learned from IAT 355.
It contains two pages: home page and visualization page. Clicking "See my visualizations!" will redirect you to my visualization page and clicking my name on the top will redirect you back to my home page. This website was built using HTML, CSS, JS and some external assests including a font and icons. Have fun!
